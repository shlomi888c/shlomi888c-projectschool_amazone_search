My  project goal is to create an application that performs real-time product searches on Amazon.com and stores the search results 	 in a   in the database.
The key objectives were to build a user-friendly interface, automate data extraction from Amazon.com, and ensure seamless deployment using DevOps tools.
We strived to achieve high scalability and availability by utilizing AWS IaaS components.

Overview and Key Components
The app is designed using Python and Flask framework, with the integration of Selenium and Chrome for data extraction from Amazon.com.
We utilized AWS IaaS, including load balancer, EC2 instances, and RDS MySQL, for hosting and managing the application.
The code deployment and management were facilitated by Terraform for infrastructure as code and chef for code configuration. Jenkins for continuous deployment.
The security aspect was enhanced by utilizing Vault as a token management system for RDS password.
